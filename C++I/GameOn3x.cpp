// Game Over to Game On

// including iostream directive tells the preprocessor to include other contents file.

#include <iostream>


// with the include String, we can not display a string output or alphabetical characters.

#include <string>


// using namespace std to avoid std:: cout repetitions in our code

using namespace std;


//funtions that returns an integer, starting point

int main()

	cout << " Game On " << endl << endl; // using the double << endl << endl; to create a space between my output

    cout << " This is my first C++ " << endl; // ending my output line of statement


	return 0; // to close the console by pressing any key when debuggong is done.
